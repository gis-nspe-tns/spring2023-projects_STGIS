            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">This project explores the risk of the urban heat island effect in New York City. At-risk communities were identified using demographic census data for minority populations in poverty, as these groups are the most vulnerable to potential environmental dangers such as heat. The final raster analysis in this project identifies which groups are most at risk through spatial correlation of social vulnerability and excessive surface temperatures. As climate change will ultimately increase urban heat temperatures, it is important to identify early groups potentially most affected. In the face of global warming, this project provides data on which communities will need to be prioritized to address urban heat risks.

              <br>
              <br>
              Robert Moses was an impactful urban planner of the early-mid 20th century, and often he let his personal biases influence his work. This analysis is based on American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates — New York (United States Census Bureau) and Baruch CUNY’s Bus Stops point layer (Donnelly). The analysis aims to highlight and address the specific challenges and disparities faced by the black community in NYC, by placing them directly in juxtaposition with their urban environment, in large part formed by Rober Moses interventions. The goal of these connections is to observe the potential impact of historical urban planning decisions on social and economic disparities in NYC’s urban fabric.

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text"> This project explores the correlation between Amtrak Services and the commute time in each county across the lower 48 states in the United States. The main method was geo-referencing historic station maps in GIS, followed by attribute development for counties with or without stations. The final result finds no significant correlation between the development of Amtrak stations and commute times at the county aggregation.

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Sea level rise and storm surges are a serious threat to coastal areas generally; and specifically coastal cities with dense habitation. Since Hurricane Sandy in 2012, New York City and New York State have begun to take this threat more seriously. In 2013, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) launched the Rebuild by Design competition in which major architectural and design firms submitted plans addressing climate change and resiliency. One of the projects selected for federal funding in this competition was Bjarke Ingels Group’s (BIG) BIG U which addressed the effects of rising sea levels and storm surge events like hurricane Sandy on the Lower half of Manhattan. The BIG U is now under construction; however, the project has morphed considerably from its original design. Part of the BIG U being worked on now is the East Side Coastal Resiliency (ESCR) project which addresses coastal areas spanning from Montgomery St. to East 23rd St. The goal of this project is to assess how effective the ESCR project will be at protecting the East River Park and surrounding area from rising sea levels and storm surges, as well as assessing the longevity of the infrastructure from a spatial analysis persective.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">The summer of 2019 was named Black Summer in remark to Australia's intense wildfires. These fires were deemed the worst of the decade and devastated the country by destroying thousands of miles of forests, killing over 30 people. With this, over 3,000 homes were destroyed and multiple countries - including the United States - were called on for assistance. The fires are thought to have been caused by heat and drought due to rapid climate change. New South Wales had the worst fires; one in particular referenced as “The Monster” occurring in The Gospers Mountain. The Gospers Mountain wildfire destroyed an area seven times the size of Singapore starting on the afternoon of October 26th. The dry air and wind rates dispersed the fire rapidly; my project focuses on the destruction of vegetation in this mountainous area. This project shows burn scars caused by the Gospers Mountain Fire by comparing before and after satellite imagery. Utilizing burn ratio and NDVI indices from the Landsat 8 program, burn pixels were determined, resulting in a classification highlighting the burn ara of the Gospers fire.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">In the wake of sea level rise and storm surges caused by climate change, what types of space and demographics do local and government planning prioritize to address our vulnerability? 
            <br>
            <br>
            Many factors intensify the vulnerability of incarcerated populations, including how stigmatization of presently and formerly incarcerated persons leads to an invisibilization of their need for vital social services and representation as citizens and how detainees lack free movement during catastrophic weather events due to security regulations, and the inability of civilians to enter jail sites during crises to perform mutual aid or volunteer work. By mapping all active carceral sites within the archipelago system of New York City, contextualizing them with their topographical elevation data, and modeling projected sea level rise from the 2020s to 2100 and storm surge data, my project aims to generate civic discourse for everyday civilians and those working within environmental justice and grassroots prison abolition organizations.</p>
